## 🚀 Quick Start (Security-First Example)

Here's a production-ready example showcasing enterprise security:

```python
from tbh_secure_agents import Expert, Operation, Squad
import os

# Create secure outputs directory
os.makedirs("secure_outputs", exist_ok=True)

# Define experts with enterprise security profiles
security_analyst = Expert(
    specialty="Cybersecurity Analyst",
    objective="Analyze security threats and provide protection recommendations",
    background="Expert in threat analysis with 95% attack prevention rate.",
    security_profile="maximum"  # Enterprise-grade security
)

compliance_expert = Expert(
    specialty="Compliance Specialist",
    objective="Ensure regulatory compliance and security standards",
    background="Specialized in enterprise security compliance and validation.",
    security_profile="high"  # High security for sensitive operations
)

# Define operations with result destinations
content_operation = Operation(
    instructions="Write a short blog post about the benefits of artificial intelligence in healthcare.",
    output_format="A well-structured blog post with a title, introduction, main points, and conclusion.",
    expert=content_writer,
    result_destination="outputs/examples/healthcare_ai_blog.md"  # Save result to a markdown file
)

analysis_operation = Operation(
    instructions="Analyze the following data and provide insights: Patient wait times decreased by 30% after implementing AI scheduling. Diagnostic accuracy improved by 15%. Treatment planning time reduced by 25%.",
    output_format="A concise analysis with key insights and recommendations.",
    expert=data_analyst,
    result_destination="outputs/examples/healthcare_data_analysis.txt"  # Save result to a text file

# Create a squad with template variables in operations
template_expert = Expert(
    specialty="Healthcare Specialist",
    objective="Provide {output_type} about healthcare technology",
    background="Expert in healthcare technology with a focus on {focus_area}.",
    security_profile="minimal"  # Using minimal security for simplicity
)

# Create an operation with template variables and conditional formatting
template_operation = Operation(
    instructions="""
    Write a {length} summary about {topic} in healthcare.

    {tone, select,
      formal:Use a professional, academic tone suitable for medical professionals.|

# Form a squad with result destination
healthcare_squad = Squad(
    experts=[content_writer, data_analyst, template_expert],
    operations=[content_operation, analysis_operation, template_operation],
    process="sequential",  # Operations run in sequence, passing results as context
    result_destination={
        "format": "json",
        "file_path": "outputs/examples/healthcare_squad_result.json"  # Save squad result to a JSON file
    }
)

# Define guardrail inputs
guardrails = {
    "output_type": "insights",
    "focus_area": "AI implementation",
    "length": "one-page",
    "topic": "artificial intelligence",
    "tone": "conversational",
    "include_statistics": "true"
}

# Deploy the squad with guardrails
result = healthcare_squad.deploy(guardrails=guardrails)

print("Squad result:", result[:100] + "...")  # Print a preview of the result
print("Results saved to the outputs/examples directory")
