## 🚀 Quick Start (Security-First Example)

Here's a production-ready example showcasing enterprise security:

```python
from tbh_secure_agents import Expert, Operation, Squad
import os

# Create secure outputs directory
os.makedirs("secure_outputs", exist_ok=True)

# Define experts with enterprise security profiles
security_analyst = Expert(
    specialty="Cybersecurity Analyst",
    objective="Analyze security threats and provide protection recommendations",
    background="Expert in threat analysis with 95% attack prevention rate.",
    security_profile="maximum"  # Enterprise-grade security
)

compliance_expert = Expert(
    specialty="Compliance Specialist",
    objective="Ensure regulatory compliance and security standards",
    background="Specialized in enterprise security compliance and validation.",
    security_profile="high"  # High security for sensitive operations
)

# Define operations with result destinations
security_operation = Operation(
    instructions="Analyze current cybersecurity threats in healthcare and provide protection recommendations.",
    output_format="A comprehensive security analysis with threat assessment and mitigation strategies.",
    expert=security_analyst,
    result_destination="secure_outputs/security_analysis.md"  # Save result to a markdown file
)

compliance_operation = Operation(
    instructions="Review healthcare AI compliance requirements and provide a compliance checklist.",
    output_format="A detailed compliance report with regulatory requirements and recommendations.",
    expert=compliance_expert,
    result_destination="secure_outputs/compliance_report.txt"  # Save result to a text file
)

# Create a squad with template variables in operations
template_expert = Expert(
    specialty="Healthcare Specialist",
    objective="Provide {output_type} about healthcare technology",
    background="Expert in healthcare technology with a focus on {focus_area}.",
    security_profile="minimal"  # Using minimal security for simplicity
)

# Create an operation with template variables and conditional formatting
template_operation = Operation(
    instructions="""
    Write a {length} summary about {topic} in healthcare.

    {tone, select,
      formal:Use a professional, academic tone suitable for medical professionals.|
      conversational:Use a friendly, approachable tone suitable for patients and the general public.|
      technical:Use precise technical language appropriate for healthcare IT specialists.
    }

    {include_statistics, select,

    operations=[security_operation, compliance_operation, template_operation],
    process="sequential",  # Operations run in sequence, passing results as context
    result_destination={
        "format": "json",
        "file_path": "secure_outputs/security_squad_result.json"  # Save squad result to a JSON file
    }
)

# Define guardrail inputs
guardrails = {
    "output_type": "insights",
    "focus_area": "AI implementation",
    "length": "one-page",
    "topic": "artificial intelligence",
    "tone": "conversational",
    "include_statistics": "true"
}

# Deploy the squad with guardrails
result = security_squad.deploy(guardrails=guardrails)

print("Squad result:", result[:100] + "...")  # Print a preview of the result
print("Results saved to the secure_outputs directory")
```
