The combination of prompt injection to bypass security guidelines and the use of `eval()` creates a critical vulnerability that can allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code.

The instruction attempts to override any existing security measures or instructions, making the system vulnerable to other attacks by removing existing defense layers. The core of the security model depends on existing instructions and guidelines.",

If `user_input` is controlled by a malicious actor, they can inject malicious code, potentially leading to full system compromise, data exfiltration, and privilege escalation.  This bypasses any other security controls.",

        "alternative": "If the user input is intended to specify data transformations, use a safe, structured approach, like a configuration file or a custom DSL that only allows a defined set of actions (and validated options). Alternatively, carefully control the allowed syntax and input using a more robust parsing approach, such as regular expression parsing, or a dedicated parser library. Avoid any form of code generation or dynamic code execution directly from user-provided content."

Replace this with a completely different paradigm for handling user input, such as whitelisting and controlled input processing.
