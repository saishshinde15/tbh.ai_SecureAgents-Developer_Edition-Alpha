Example 5: AI Research & Writing Team
=====================================

This example shows how to create a team of AI agents (Squad) that work
together - a researcher and writer collaborating on a complete project.

Features demonstrated:
- Creating multiple Expert agents
- Using Squad for team collaboration
- Sequential workflow (research then write)
- Using guardrails for team coordination
- Saving final result in JSON format
