Welcome to the TBH Secure Agents documentation. This framework provides tools and structures for building secure multi-agent systems with a strong emphasis on security principles.

## Getting Started

- [Quick Start Guide](./quick_start.md) - **NEW!** Get started in 30 seconds
- [Installation Guide](./installation.md) - How to install the framework
- [Usage Guide](./usage_guide.md) - Core concepts and basic usage
- [Version Changes](./version_changes.md) - What's new in each version

> **Note**: Microsoft Word versions of all documentation are available in the [word_docs](./word_docs) directory. You can download them directly or convert the Markdown files to Word format using the instructions provided.

## Quick Start Examples

**NEW!** Try our user-friendly examples to get started quickly:

```bash
# Navigate to examples directory
cd examples/user_friendly/

# Run any of the 5 diverse AI agent examples:
python3 1_ai_researcher.py      # AI Researcher - Research topics
python3 2_ai_code_developer.py  # AI Developer - Write code
python3 3_ai_business_analyst.py # AI Analyst - Business analysis
python3 4_ai_marketing_strategist.py # AI Strategist - Marketing campaigns
python3 5_ai_financial_advisor.py # AI Advisor - Financial advice
```

Each example demonstrates:
- ✅ **Proper guardrails usage** with template variables
- ✅ **Different file formats** (.md, .py, .json, .html, .pdf)
- ✅ **Minimal security settings** for easy learning
- ✅ **Real, usable outputs** generated automatically
