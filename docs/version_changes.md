- Improved package reliability and ease of installation

## New Guardrails System

The most significant enhancement in this version is the introduction of a comprehensive guardrails system that allows for dynamic control of expert behavior at runtime.

### Template Variables

You can now use template variables in expert profiles and operation instructions:

```python
# Expert with template variables
expert = Expert(
    specialty="Content Writer specializing in {domain}",
    objective="Create {content_type} content for {audience}",
    background="You have experience writing {tone} content about {domain}."
)

# Operation with template variables
operation = Operation(
    instructions="Write a {length} article about {topic} for {audience}.",
    output_format="A well-formatted {content_type}"
)
```

These variables are replaced with values from the guardrails when the squad is deployed:

```python
result = squad.deploy(guardrails={
    "domain": "healthcare",
    "content_type": "blog post",
    "audience": "medical professionals",
    "tone": "professional",
    "length": "1000-word",
    "topic": "AI in medical diagnosis"
})
```

### Conditional Formatting with Select Syntax

The new select syntax allows for conditional content based on guardrail values:

```python
operation = Operation(
    instructions="""
    Write a report about {topic}.

    {tone, select,
      formal:Use a professional, academic tone suitable for scholarly publications.|
      conversational:Use a friendly, approachable tone as if speaking directly to the reader.|
      technical:Use precise technical language appropriate for experts in the field.
    }

    {include_examples, select,
      true:Include practical examples to illustrate key points.|
      false:Focus on theoretical concepts without specific examples.
    }
    """,
    expert=content_expert
)
```

This powerful feature enables dynamic instruction generation based on runtime parameters.
